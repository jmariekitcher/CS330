How do I approach designing software
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft? I can now change colors, and add objects to create an image on a plane. 
What design process did you follow for your project work? I worked on one object in its entirety, and then replicated it to finish the whole scene. 
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work? I think that re-using code from a small piece to build upon to create a larger piece is a big part of programming, regardless of whether it is using graphics/visualizations or working with other types of code. 

How do I approach developing programs
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene? I really leaned on writing a small amount of code, testing it, adjusting it slightly, then testing it again. 
How did iteration factor into your development? 
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway? 
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
